# Pig Game ðŸŽ²

Pig Game is a fun two-player dice game where players compete to reach a target score first. Itâ€™s a turn-based game where strategy and luck collideâ€”be careful, rolling a `1` can ruin your turn!

## Gameplay Rules

1. The game starts with **two players**.
2. On their turn, a player can:
   - **Roll the dice**: Add the dice value to their current score unless the dice rolls a `1`.
   - **Hold**: Save their current score to their total score and pass the turn to the other player.
3. If a player rolls a `1`, their current score resets, and it's the other player's turn.
4. The first player to reach the target score (default: **100**) wins the game.
